	<h1>The effects of solitary confinement on mental health</h1>
	
	<p>Solitary confinement is a widely debated topic in our criminal justice system alongside the death penalty. There is a controversy surrounding the 
morality of isolating a human for long periods. This method of punishment is growing in the United States as an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 inmates are 
held in solitary confinement (<a href="https://www.penalreform.org/issues/prison-conditions/key-facts/solitary-confinement/"><i class='fas 
fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Solitary confinement")</a>. Some inmates can see up to 22 hours to 24 hours in isolation for sometimes up to a 
month with minimal meaningful interaction with others (<a href="https://www.penalreform.org/issues/prison-conditions/key-facts/solitary-confinement/"><i class='fas 
fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Solitary confinement")</a>. The isolation in itself could cause numerous mental health issues but the deprival of 
human interaction also negatively impacts these inmates. These individuals often get denied contact with family or visitors, despite family to have been 
shown as an important factor in successful rehabilitation (<a href="https://www.penalreform.org/issues/prison-conditions/key-facts/solitary-confinement/"><i class='fas 
fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Solitary confinement")</a>. Inmates in isolation are placed in an environment where mental deterioration is 
expected. One inmate, Jordan, described his experience of going into the SHU, security housing unit when he was 16. He reported feeling 'changed' as if he 
"aged ten years just by doing 20 days in there" (<a 
href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43b3jp/the-unreal-horror-of-being-locked-in-solitary-confinement-when-i-was-16"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Eldridge, 2018)</a>. </p>

		<div class="overlay_text">Jordan stated he had nothing to do but think about everything in his life and a majority of the time his thoughts were about the negatives about his ongoing case and troubles at home (<a 
	href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43b3jp/the-unreal-horror-of-being-locked-in-solitary-confinement-when-i-was-16"><i class='fas fa-link' 
	style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Eldridge, 2018)</a>. For young inmates in the SHU, they receive no sort of teaching or schooling during an important 
	developmental phase as a young adult. He wasn't allowed to attend programs while in there so a teacher would come twice a week and bring a folder 
filled with worksheets, articles, and puzzles. When they wouldn't even collect the work he did he asked "Well, what did you bring it for?... Some of 
this stuff I needed help on, some of this stuff in here I didn't understand"(<a 
	href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43b3jp/the-unreal-horror-of-being-locked-in-solitary-confinement-when-i-was-16"><i class='fas fa-link' 
	style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Eldridge, 2018)</a>. When Jordan got out of the SHU he reported that it was difficult for 
him to readjust to human interaction because he 
	was so used to being alone; he felt the only person there for him was himself (<a 
	href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43b3jp/the-unreal-horror-of-being-locked-in-solitary-confinement-when-i-was-16"><i class='fas fa-link' 
	style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Eldridge, 2018)</a>.</div>

	</div>

<p> Solitary can effect not only your personality, mental health, and in Jordan's case education. Jordan had felt changed. He believes he is now more in tune with himself because of 
solitary where he had plenty of time to get to know himself (<a 
href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43b3jp/the-unreal-horror-of-being-locked-in-solitary-confinement-when-i-was-16"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Eldridge, 2018)</a>. Medical research has proven that 
the denial of meaningful human contact can lead to 'isolation syndrome' or 'solitary confinement syndrome'. Some of the noted symptoms are 
hyperresponsivity to external stimuli, perceptual distortions, hallucinations, derealization experiences, problems with impulse control, difficulty with 
concentrating and memory, increased anxiety, depression, anger, paranoia, psychosis, self-harm, and suicide (<a href="https://www.penalreform.org/issues/prison-conditions/key-facts/solitary-confinement/"><i class='fas 
fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Solitary confinement"</a>; <a href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/handouts/CCJ%20102716%20Item%203%20Dr%20Grassian%20Psychopathological%20Effects%20of%20Solitary%20Confinement.pdf"><i class='fas 
fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Grassian, 1983)</a>. Solitary confinement has been proven to alter neural and therefore psychological states causing 
these individuals (28%) to have higher rates of psychopathologies than the general population (15%) (<a 
href="https://solitarywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fact-sheet-psychological-effects-final.pdf"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Rodriguez, 2011)</a>. Prisoners in isolation have also been statistically shown to engage in self-mutilation at higher rates 
than those of the general population (<a 
href="https://solitarywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fact-sheet-psychological-effects-final.pdf"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Rodriguez, 2011)</a>. Self-mutilation is typically a warning sign of suicide. Solitary confinement has a high correlation to 
suicide rates. In 2005, within the California prison system, 70% of forty-four prisoners who had committed suicide were in solitary confinement (<a 
href="https://solitarywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fact-sheet-psychological-effects-final.pdf"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Rodriguez, 2011)</a>. Craig Haney, a psychology professor from the University of California Santa Cruz, has spent the past 
thirty years studying solitary confinement units and their long-term effects on prisoners. Haney highlighted the core irrationalities in the logic of 
solitary confinement: </p>

	<div class="blockquote">	
		<p><q>these units make the ability to withstand the psychological assault of extreme isolation a prerequisite for allowing prisoners to return to 
the intensely social world of mainline prison or free society. In this way, prisoners who cannot 'handle' the profound isolation of supermax 
confinement are almost always doomed to be retained in it. And those who have adapted all too well to the deprivation, restriction, and pervasive 
control are prime candidates for release to a social world to which they may be incapable of ever fully readjusting</q></p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Solitary confinement teaches problematic psychological habits to prisoners. The logic is irrational and promotes psychological distress to reenter 
society. In addition to the negative psychological effects of solitary, there is another important mental health issue raised by these conditions of 
the number of mentally ill prisoners who get placed in isolation.</p>

	<h1>Mental illness in solitary confinement</h1>
	
	<p>The use of solitary confinement is justified by states as a disciplinary punishment for prisoners or to protect other prisoners. As a part of this, 
prison staff uses solitary to help 'manage' certain individuals (<a href="https://www.penalreform.org/issues/prison-conditions/key-facts/solitary-confinement/"><i class='fas 
fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Solitary confinement")</a>. These certain individuals more than often include prisoners who have or are perceived 
to have mental illnesses. The symptoms of mental illness in prison, such as being noisy or disruptive, refusing orders, self-mutilating, or attempting 
suicide can cause prison staff to house the mentally ill in isolation pushing them over the edge to psychosis (<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/09/05/us-number-mentally-ill-prisons-quadrupled#"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"U.S.: Number 
of Mentally Ill in Prisons Quadrupled", 2006)</a>. The harsh setting of isolation worsens the mental conditions of these prisoners making it hard to ever 
receive treatment. Also, as their symptoms get worse this makes them more prone to the behaviors that got them put into solitary to begin with, resulting 
in longer and more frequent stays in isolation. A 2003 report from the Human Rights Watch found that one-third to one-half of prisoners in isolation 
suffered from some mental illness 
(<a href="https://solitarywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fact-sheet-psychological-effects-final.pdf"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' 
></i>Rodriguez, 2011)</a>. Placing these individuals in isolation further deteriorates their mental health while also restricting their access to any 
programs they may need for treatment. </p>

	<h1>What is being done or can be done?</h1>

	<p>The United Nations Human Rights had declared that for juveniles, all cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is strictly prohibited including 
"placement in a dark cell, closed or solitary confinement or any other punishment that may compromise the physical or mental health of the juvenile 
concerned" (<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/JuvenilesDeprivedOfLiberty.aspx"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' 
></i>UNHR, 1990)</a>. Solitary confinement has been recognized as a cruel and inhumane treatment for juveniles by the United Nations and should also be for 
adults. Solitary confinement conflicts with the eighth amendment preventing the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments. Solitary confinement increases 
the risk of torture or ill-treatment going unnoticed and in itself can represent torture (<a href="https://www.penalreform.org/issues/prison-conditions/key-facts/solitary-confinement/"><i class='fas 
fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Solitary confinement")</a>. Solitary encourages maltreatment of prisoners and should only be used as a last resort 
and possibly only for the most dangerous prisoners. When used though, prisons should ensure that meaningful human interactions are available. This can be 
done by introducing more staff-prisoner contact, access to social activities with other prisoners, visits, and in-depth talks with mental health 
professionals and religious personnel (<a href="https://www.penalreform.org/issues/prison-conditions/key-facts/solitary-confinement/"><i class='fas 
fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Solitary confinement")</a>. Craig Haney also proposed that research is critical to analyze, modify, and reform the 
harsh conditions; understanding the psychological impacts would result in the most effective programs for prisoners to cope after isolation (<a 
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0011128702239239"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Haney, 
2003)</a>.  He highlights the need for the development of programs that would assist prisoners with "unlearning problematic habits of thinking, feeling, 
and acting on which their psychological survival in supermax often depends" (<a 
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0011128702239239"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Haney, 
2003)</a>. </p>
