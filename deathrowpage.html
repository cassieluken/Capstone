	<h1>What's it like living on death row?</h1>
	<p>Death row inmates experience the harshest sentencing in our criminal justice system. Death row inmates are typically incarcerated in solitary 
confinement so the mental health issues tend to overlap. <a href="solitarypage.html">(Click here to see the solitary confinement tab)</a> The death penalty 
information center recognizes that these inmates are subject to much more deprivation and harsher conditions when compared to other prisoners (<a 
href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/conditions-on-death-row"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Conditions on Death Row")</a>.  
These conditions lead to a decline in mental health as they spend extensive time in isolation. Nearly half of the people executed nationwide between 2000 
and 2015 had been diagnosed with a mental illness by a professional at some point in their lives (<a 
href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/31/mental-health-care-crisis-overwhelming-prison-jail"> <i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' 
></i>Roth, 2018)</a>. The conditions of isolation and the lengthy time spent on death row acerbates inmates' conditions (<a 
href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/conditions-on-death-row"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Conditions on Death Row")</a>. 
The time spent on death row alone could cause mental health issues from tension and suspense. Time can contribute to the worsening of mental health but as 
of now, long periods are needed to complete the death penalty appeals correctly for inmates (<a 
href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/conditions-on-death-row"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Conditions on Death Row")</a>.
 Because of the nature of the death penalty, the system needs to spend time to assure innocent people are not executed to avoid grave injustices for these 
individuals but this can cause inmates to wait twenty years or more in degrading conditions while their cases are reviewed (<a 
href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/conditions-on-death-row"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Conditions on Death Row")</a>.
 So not only is the time spent under these conditions lengthy, but there is a lot more pressure in the reevaluation process. These retrials could be the 
difference between living or dying which creates a more stressful and depressing environment for these inmates. The stress is high especially for Alabama 
death row inmates. Alabama has the largest death row per capita in the US and the nation's highest death sentencing rate; additionally, Alabama does not 
provide legal assistance when inmates want to challenge any inadequate representation they had experienced unlike all other death penalty states 
(<a href="https://eji.org/news/alabama-death-penalty-generates-criticism/"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Alabama's Death Penalty 
System Generates Growing Criticism", 2016)</a>. There is also no state-wide public defender for Alabama. The legal team inmates have is usually a deciding 
factor of whether or not a defendant will be sentenced to death, creating added pressure to try to get a good legal team when one is not appointed to you 
(<a href="https://eji.org/news/alabama-death-penalty-generates-criticism/"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Alabama's Death Penalty 
System...", 2016)</a>. Those with mental illness are also more "...likely to fire their defense lawyers, or not cooperate with them, or even try to 
represent themselves” therefore adding more pressure to the retrial process (<a 
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/04/17/he-s-living-with-severe-mental-illness-should-he-face-the-death-penalty"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Chammah, 2019)</a>. Alabama has the highest numbers and does not assist inmates, pushing them down a dark, 
hopeless, and depressive path. Outside of the retrial process, the living conditions are described as toxic. One death row inmate, Paul Brown, describes 
his experience finding his friend and fellow death row inmate attempting suicide. Brown admitted that he felt that the other inmates, who knew his friend 
was in a locked closet by himself for nearly 30 minutes, were disappointed and upset with him as if he "were spoiling the fun" since suicide attempts feel 
welcomed (<a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/12/06/should-i-have-let-my-friend-on-death-row-kill-himself"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>2018)</a>. Brown confessed that it is easier to succumb: </p>

	<div class="blockquote">	
		<p><q>There is no disappointment when there are no expectations. We don't live on death row; we wait to die</q></p>
		<div class="blockquote-footer">
			<p>-Paul Brown, <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/12/06/should-i-have-let-my-friend-on-death-row-kill-himself" 
style='color:#d92626'> <i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;'></i> <q>Should I Have Let My Friend on Death Row Kill Himself?</q></a></p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<p>These inmates experience hopelessness, just waiting for the next inevitable phase of death. Brown describes the environment of death row as 
constantly reinforcing death "From our clothing (red jumpsuits) to the walls of the unit (also painted blood red), every day is a crime 
scene. When we go outside, we’re surrounded by guards on high platforms with high-powered rifles pointed at us" (<a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/12/06/should-i-have-let-my-friend-on-death-row-kill-himself"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Brown, 2018)</a>. The environment and lifestyle had effected Brown enough to get him to question himself for saving his 
friend and asking if death is preferable to death row (<a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/12/06/should-i-have-let-my-friend-on-death-row-kill-himself"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Brown, 2018)</a>. Death is the theme of every day for these inmates leaving them to thoughts of suicide. Brown has noticed 
that "Living on death row is a contradiction. Some become overwhelmed by the perpetual thought of death looming over our heads, the denial of all physical 
contact with loved ones or any other human beings, and the daily indignities to our personhood. Others fight like hell and cling to the tiniest semblances 
of life: a letter, a visit, a handshake, a smile" (<a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/12/06/should-i-have-let-my-friend-on-death-row-kill-himself"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Brown, 2018)</a>. The constant reminder of death and denial of any healing factors like physical contact strip away 
willpower. Clinging to tiny symbols of life is their last plea of help before they lose hope and come to understand the theme of death row is death. 
Feelings of being hopeless are linked to depression and affect your mood and thinking (<a 
href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-symptoms-causes#1"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"What Are the Causes and Symptoms of Depression")</a>.
 Depression and suicide reinforce each other here as people obsess over death. From 1977 through 2010, the rate of suicides on death row averaged 2.74, 
while the mean per 100,000 was 129.7 annually (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1556-4029.13069"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Tartaro & Lester, 2016)</a>. These numbers, when compared to the rate of suicide outside of prison and for inmates in state prisons at 
that time, are significantly higher. The general inmate population has a regular prison setting where they spend a majority of the time surrounded by other 
inmates. For death row inmates they primarily serve in solitary confinement making suicide more possible with the lack of intervention of other inmates and 
officers and leaving a larger psychological impact of stress and despair when compared to most state prison inmates (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1556-4029.13069"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Tartaro & Lester, 2016)</a>. When California built a psychiatric unit on its death row at San Quentin the 40 beds were filled immediately (<a 
href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/31/mental-health-care-crisis-overwhelming-prison-jail"> <i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' 
></i>Roth, 2018)</a>. The suicide numbers, the differences in conditions, and the theme of death looming in this environment shows the necessity for mental 
health care for death row inmates.   Whether inmates receive psychiatric treatment programs or focus groups, death row inmates deserve additional resources 
due to the nature of their environment and death sentences. </p>

<h1>A call for the ban of the death penalty for the mentally ill</h1>

<p>This discussion has mentioned the living conditions and retrial process when already sentenced to the death penalty, but for those who are mentally ill 
and risk being charged with the death penalty, many also see a problem with this. Heath Otto was diagnosed with schizophrenia and awaits trial for 
strangling his mother and nephew and then slitting their throats (<a 
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/04/17/he-s-living-with-severe-mental-illness-should-he-face-the-death-penalty"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Chammah, 2019)</a>. (See about his case here: (<a 
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/04/17/he-s-living-with-severe-mental-illness-should-he-face-the-death-penalty"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"He’s Living With Severe Mental Illness. Should He Face the Death Penalty? ")</a> The significance of this case is that Otto 
was ruled as incompetent to stand trial but now the state's attorney may seek the death penalty.</p>

		<div class="overlay_text">Otto had claimed, falsely, that his mother and nephew had medical conditions and he intended to “put them out of their 
misery.” He later said “It was an order from the CIA, and then he said stuff about Hillary Clinton, and if he 
didn’t do it it was going to be World War III”(<a 
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/04/17/he-s-living-with-severe-mental-illness-should-he-face-the-death-penalty"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Chammah, 2019)</a>. Because of his diagnoses, after the incident Otto had to wait over a month for a bed to open in the only 
public psychiatric hospital in the state. The state attorney has not formally announced that they will be pursuing the death penalty, but Otto's sister, 
the mother of Otto's nephew, Cassandra Otto has commented "I do forgive him, in a way, because I know my mom tried getting him help,...I’m in a phase where I don’t know if he’s faking it or he’s really mentally ill.” But, she added, “I think he should get the death 
penalty no matter what, because my family doesn’t deserve what happened to us. My sister disagrees, because that wasn’t her kid." She said her brother 
“knew what he was doing"(<a 
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/04/17/he-s-living-with-severe-mental-illness-should-he-face-the-death-penalty"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Chammah, 2019)</a>. </div>
	  </div>
	</div>
<p>This process is causing more strain on the family members and between family members than Otto. Otto's other sister, Aleesha DeKnikker, has announced that "killing another 
member of our family in no way honors my mom's life..." (<a 
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/04/17/he-s-living-with-severe-mental-illness-should-he-face-the-death-penalty"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Chammah, 2019)</a>. This process and the threat of the death penalty not only places mental strains on the perpetrators but 
others as well, whether it be family or friends of the perpetrator or even the victims. A friend of Otto's mother stated:</p>
	
	<div class="blockquote">	
		<p><q>If he understood what he did to his mother, he would probably try to commit suicide. It’s much easier to kill a mentally ill man than to 
admit your mental health system, your law enforcement, your policies and procedure are so inept</q></p>
		<div class="blockquote-footer">

	<p>She sees the entire case as an example of the way our society treats those with severe mental health problems (<a 
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/04/17/he-s-living-with-severe-mental-illness-should-he-face-the-death-penalty"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Chammah, 2019)</a>. People with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are considered cognitively 
impaired when it comes to decision-making (<a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/mental-illness"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 
15px;' ></i>"Mental Illness")</a>. At this point, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Bar Association have called for a ban on the death 
penalty for those with severe mental illness due to several possibilities: the lack of understanding their crime and its consequences, their impairment in 
decision-making, and their mental incompetence (<a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/mental-illness"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 
15px;' ></i>"Mental Illness")</a>. </p>

	<h1>What is being done or can be done?</h1>
	
	<p>Many legal experts have declared that prolonged isolation is a form of cruel and unusual punishment, comparable to torture (<a 
href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/conditions-on-death-row"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Conditions on Death 
Row")</a>. If experts deem the lifestyle of death row inmates as cruel and unusual this violates the eighth amendment and therefore should be abolished. 
Since time under these conditions causes even further harm, the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) provides rules governing inmates on death row in 
each state and tracks the amount of time inmates spend under these conditions (<a 
href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/conditions-on-death-row"><i class='fas fa-link' style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>"Conditions on Death 
Row")</a>. In this case, time is not easily altered. There still seems to be a struggle to find a way to lessen the time spent on death row, therefore the 
worsening of mental health issues, while also properly overseeing all death penalty appeals. The whole death penalty sentencing should be reviewed since 
the conditions cause serious mental health issues. For those who come into their sentence with a mental health issue already, there have been proposals and 
bills to ban death sentences for people with serious mental health illnesses some including PTSD, and others limited to schizophrenia, schizoaffective 
disorder and bipolar disorder (<a 
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/04/17/he-s-living-with-severe-mental-illness-should-he-face-the-death-penalty"><i class='fas fa-link' 
style='font-size: 15px;' ></i>Chammah, 2019)</a>. The "insanity defense" continues to be narrowly defined and juries are skeptical which then effects the 
outcome of these trials. The Supreme Court has already banned the death penalty for those with intellectual disabilities so mental health issues should be 
the next step.</p>
