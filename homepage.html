        <p>Mental health in the prison system is a topic that sometimes goes unnoticed. The purpose of this project is 
		to collect resources and qualitative and quantitative data that discusses mental health strains within subtopics of the prison system.</p>

        <p>
		There are many factors in our Criminal Justice System that place strain on individuals involved within each level of the system. Lower-level 
individuals, otherwise referred to as prisoners or inmates, experience many strains as can be expected but the lasting effects result in 
 symptoms of mental illness or the worsening of these conditions. Middle-level individuals, otherwise referred to as the Correctional Officers and Staff of 
these prisons, may also experience conditions that cause burnout and mental health issues. <br> For research purposes, local jail data is used in some 
cases to support prison data.</p>
